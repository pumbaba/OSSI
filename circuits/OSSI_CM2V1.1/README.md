# O.S.S.I Control Module 2 V1.1

This version of the control module contains only bug fixes to version V1.0.

These are either changes to the BOM (values of components) or changes on the PCB which are only fixable on version 1.0 by hardware modifications.
Changes to the PCB are limited to fixes that restore the original design idea. E.g. connection of a voltage divider to the correct net to remove undesired voltage drop.
Component references and positions are kept the same as on version 1.0.

If there are hardware modifications that add components, add functionality or remove functionality these must be done in a version 2.0 of the module.
